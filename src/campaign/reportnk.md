# Smart Contract Security Audit Report

## Overview
This report analyzes the security vulnerabilities in the given smart contract and highlights three high-severity issues. For each issue, we provide an explanation of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, the affected contract sections, and the recommended remediation.

---

## 1. **Reentrancy Attack in `_transfer` Function**

### **Severity: High**

### **Vulnerability Explanation**
The `_transfer` function allows the transfer of native tokens (ETH) using a low-level `.call{value: amount}("")`. If the receiver is a smart contract, it can execute a callback function that recursively calls `_transfer`, leading to a reentrancy attack.

### **Affected Code**
```solidity
function _transfer(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
        (bool sent,) = to.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!sent) revert NativeTokenTransferFailed();
    } else {
        SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(token), to, amount);
    }
}
```

### **Attack Scenario**
1. A malicious contract receives ETH through `_transfer`.
2. It immediately calls back into `_transfer` before the original function execution is completed.
3. This allows the attacker to withdraw more ETH than intended, draining the contract's funds.

### **Remediation**
- Implement a reentrancy guard using OpenZeppelin’s `ReentrancyGuard`.
- Use a **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern to update balances before transferring ETH.
- Example Fix:
  ```solidity
  function _transfer(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal nonReentrant {
      if (token == NATIVE_TOKEN) {
          (bool sent,) = to.call{ value: amount }("");
          if (!sent) revert NativeTokenTransferFailed();
      } else {
          SafeERC20.safeTransfer(IERC20(token), to, amount);
      }
  }
  ```

## 2. **Front-Running Attack on `deployAndFundCampaign`**

### **Severity: High**

### **Vulnerability Explanation**
The function `deployAndFundCampaign` allows anyone to deploy a campaign by providing parameters and sending reward tokens. However, an attacker monitoring the transaction pool can execute a front-running attack by preemptively deploying a campaign with the same parameters, causing the legitimate user’s transaction to fail or leading to fund misallocation.

### **Affected Code**
```solidity
bytes32 salt = keccak256(
    abi.encode(
        holdingPeriodInSeconds,
        targetToken,
        rewardToken,
        rewardPPQ,
        campaignAdmin,
        startTimestamp,
        FEE_BPS,
        alternativeWithdrawalAddress,
        uuid
    )
);
campaign = Create2.deploy(0, salt, bytecode);
```

### **Attack Scenario**
1. A user submits a transaction to deploy and fund a campaign.
2. A malicious actor sees the transaction in the mempool and submits the same transaction with a higher gas fee.
3. The attacker’s transaction is processed first, causing the victim’s transaction to fail or misallocate funds.

### **Remediation**
- Use **access control mechanisms** to ensure only authorized addresses can deploy campaigns.
- Introduce a **commit-reveal scheme** where the campaign creator first submits a hashed commitment before revealing parameters.
- Example Fix:
  ```solidity
  mapping(bytes32 => bool) private usedSalts;
  function deployCampaign(bytes32 salt, ...) public {
      require(!usedSalts[salt], "Salt already used");
      usedSalts[salt] = true;
      ... // deploy logic
  }
  ```

## 3. **Incorrect Token Approval in `handleReallocation`**

### **Severity: High**

### **Vulnerability Explanation**
In `handleReallocation`, the contract uses `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens. If the sender has approved an excessive token amount, an attacker can exploit this by replacing the legitimate recipient and redirecting the funds.

### **Affected Code**
```solidity
SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(tokenReceived, msg.sender, address(this), balanceOfSender);
```

### **Attack Scenario**
1. A user approves a high allowance for the contract.
2. A malicious actor gains access to modify `msg.sender` (e.g., through a compromised `factory` contract).
3. The attacker calls `handleReallocation` and drains the victim’s approved funds.

### **Remediation**
- Use `permit()` instead of `approve()` to minimize approval risks.
- Limit the approval amount to the actual required value.
- Ensure that `msg.sender` has appropriate permissions to call `handleReallocation`.
- Example Fix:
  ```solidity
  SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom(tokenReceived, msg.sender, address(this), toAmount);
  ```

## **Conclusion**
These three high-severity vulnerabilities can lead to fund loss, contract exploitation, and denial of service. Implementing the recommended fixes will significantly improve the security of the contract and protect user funds.

### **Summary of High Severity Issues**
| Vulnerability                                    | Impact                                   | Remediation                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Reentrancy in `_transfer`                        | Allows attackers to drain contract funds | Use `nonReentrant` modifier, follow CEI pattern    |
| Front-Running in `deployAndFundCampaign`         | Attackers can hijack campaigns           | Implement access control, use commit-reveal scheme |
| Incorrect Token Approval in `handleReallocation` | Attackers can drain user funds           | Use `permit()`, limit approvals                    |

By addressing these vulnerabilities, the contract can be made significantly more secure against common attacks in the Ethereum ecosystem. ✅
